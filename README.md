# dyndns_update
dyndns update script with config file or cl arguments

I wanted to create a small script to update the DNS settings of my domain with my provider. It takes a URL and parameters from a file or from command line arguments. E.g. a parameter in my case is an id (q=12345) I received from my provider as an identifier.
I used this project to play around with argparse and yaml.
